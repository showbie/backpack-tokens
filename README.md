# Backpack Design Tokens

**[DEPRECATED] Package moved to [showbie/backpack](https://github.com/showbie/backpack) monorepo**

A design token is an abstraction of a visual property such as colour, font, width, animation, etc. These raw values are language-agnostic and once transformed and formatted can be used on any platform.
