# Colours

Intro to colours.

## Showbie colours

### Blues

Show an overview of the blue scale here.

#### Alice Blue

<ColorSwatch color="#f1faff" />

A super-super-light blue used in:
  - panel background for pending group invites
  - header background for post list headers
    e.g. announcements-only, new live-update posts
  - hover, active, and focused state of text box .handle, in
    slightly transparentized form.

##### Notes:

  - hover variant was decided during dev (not spec'd via PSD) so
    could be easily expressed as SCSS function relative to main
    definition.
  - use in .handle states was decided during dev. Use here is not
    closely coupled with the other two contexts. Debatable
    whether the addition of transparency makes sense (default
    state of handles is opaque), and whether hover state is
    needed, given that the cursor also changes on hover.

#### Picton Blue
