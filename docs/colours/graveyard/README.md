Replace uses of this with `#f8f8f8`

Colour for background of popovers. Seems to be used pretty
consistently.

Darker than background of master panel, since borderless white
fields need to have some contrast on top. Also used for search
field background in group invite wizard and modified to form the
active state of buttons in the export grades popover. Those ones
are a little arbitrary but look OK as is.
